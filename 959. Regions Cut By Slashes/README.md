# Regions by Slashes

## Problem Description

An `n x n` grid is composed of `1 x 1` squares where each `1 x 1` square consists of a `'/'`, `'\'`, or blank space `' '`. These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.

Given the grid `grid` represented as a string array, return *the number of regions*.

Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a `'\'` is represented as `'\\'`.

## Solution Explanation

The solution employs a union-find data structure (or disjoint-set) to keep track of the connected components in the grid. The grid is divided into four segments per cell (top, right, bottom, left). Each segment is treated as a separate region that might be connected to its neighboring segments.

Here’s how the solution works:

1. **Initialization**: Each segment of each cell is treated as its own unique component. We initialize a union-find data structure with `n * n * 4` components, where `n` is the size of the grid.

2. **Union Operations**: For each cell, the solution performs union operations based on the type of slash and its neighboring cells:
   - For `/`, the top-right and bottom-left triangles of the cell are connected, and similarly, the top-left and bottom-right triangles are connected.
   - For `\`, the top-left and bottom-right triangles of the cell are connected, and similarly, the top-right and bottom-left triangles are connected.
   - For empty cells, all four triangles are connected to each other.

3. **Final Count**: After processing the entire grid, the number of distinct regions is obtained by counting the number of unique components in the union-find structure.

## Approach

1. **Union-Find Initialization**: Create an array `s` where each entry starts as its own parent, representing each segment as its own component.

2. **Union Operations**: For each cell, depending on the presence of slashes, connect the corresponding segments and update the component count accordingly.

3. **Final Calculation**: The total number of regions is reduced by counting the number of unique sets in the union-find data structure.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: $O(n^2 * α(n^2))$, where α is the inverse Ackermann function, which is nearly constant.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n^2)$, as we use an array to keep track of each segment in the grid.
