# Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together II

This C++ solution finds the minimum swaps needed to group all `1`s in a circular binary array using a sliding window approach.

## Problem

A swap is defined as taking two distinct positions in an array and swapping the values in them.

A circular array is defined as an array where we consider the first element and the last element to be adjacent.

Given a binary circular array `nums`, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1's present in the array together at any location.

## Approach

1. **Count the Number of 1's**: First, we count the total number of `1`s in the array (`numOfOnes`).

2. **Handle Edge Cases**: If the array contains no `1`s or is entirely composed of `1`s, no swaps are needed.

3. **Initialize Sliding Window**:
   - Set up two pointers, `left` and `right`, to track the window that contains `numOfOnes` elements.
   - Count the number of `0`s within this initial window (`zero`).

4. **Slide the Window**:
   - Move the window across the array, updating the count of `0`s by incrementing `right` and `left` pointers.
   - Use the modulus operator to handle the circular nature of the array.
   - Track the minimum number of `0`s found in any window, which corresponds to the minimum swaps needed.

5. **Return the Result**: The minimum number of `0`s encountered in any window gives the minimum number of swaps required.


## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where n is the size of the array, since we traverse the array elements once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as no additional space proportional to input size is used.
