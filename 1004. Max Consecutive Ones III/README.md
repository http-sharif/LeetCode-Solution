# Maximum Consecutive Ones III

## Problem Description

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, the task is to return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most `k` 0's to 1's.

## Solution Approach

The solution uses a sliding window approach to track the maximum length of a subarray containing 1's, where at most `k` 0's can be flipped to 1's. It iterates through the array, expanding the window by adding elements from the right until the number of 0's exceeds `k`. When this happens, the left side of the window is shrunk until the number of 0's is within the allowed limit again.

## Code Explanation

### `longestOnes` Function

- **Initial Variables**: 
  - `mx`: Tracks the maximum length of consecutive 1's.
  - `l`: Left pointer of the sliding window.
  - `numOfZero`: Counts the number of 0's in the current window.

- **Looping through the array**:
  - For each element, if it's a 0, increment `numOfZero`.
  - If `numOfZero` exceeds `k`, the current window has too many 0's. Update `mx` with the maximum length seen so far, then move the left pointer to reduce the number of 0's in the window.

- **Final Calculation**:
  - After the loop, update `mx` with the maximum length possible by considering the remaining elements in the window.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. The sliding window only moves forward, making it a linear scan.
- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the solution only uses a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
